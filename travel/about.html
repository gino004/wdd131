            <h2>The idea of â€‹creating this path</h2>
            <div class="idea">The idea of â€‹â€‹founding Estrella Travel Agency was born in 2010 in the heart of Cusco, Peru, inspired by the passion of two traveling friends, LucÃ­a and Javier. They both shared a fascination with the natural and cultural wonders of their country,
                and realized that many tourists were failing to capture the true essence of Peru due to a lack of authentic, well-organized experiences. LucÃ­a, with her extensive knowledge of history and archaeology, and Javier, an expert in logistics
                and hospitality, decided to combine their skills to offer something different. They began organizing small personalized tours of Machu Picchu and the Sacred Valley, prioritizing respect for local culture and environmental sustainability.
                Their approach soon gained popularity, and Estrella Travel Agency became synonymous with quality and authenticity in Peruvian tourism. Motivated by local success, LucÃ­a and Javier decided to expand. In 2013, they opened offices in Lima
                and Arequipa, offering tour packages that covered all of Peru, from the coastal beaches to the Amazon jungle. But his vision went beyond national borders. They wanted to share the same passion for authentic and enriching travel with the
                rest of the world. Thus, in 2015, Estrella Travel Agency began offering international trips. Buenos Aires, with its vibrant culture and passionate tango, and Rio de Janeiro, with its carnival and iconic beaches, quickly became favorite
                destinations. The agency was committed to taking its clients not only to see places, but to live transformative experiences. Today, Estrella Travel Agency is known for its dedication to excellence and personalized approach. Each trip is
                designed with care, ensuring travelers leave with lasting memories and a deeper understanding of the places they visit. From its humble beginnings in Cusco, the agency has grown to become a benchmark in the world of tourism, always maintaining
                its fundamental values â€‹â€‹of authenticity, respect and passion for discovery. With offices now in several Latin American countries, Estrella Travel Agency continues to innovate, seeking new ways to surprise and delight its clients. LucÃ­a
                and Javier, still passionate about travel, continue to lead the company with the same vision that prompted them to start this adventure: to show the world that traveling is much more than simply moving from one place to another; It is
                an opportunity to connect, learn and grow.</div>
